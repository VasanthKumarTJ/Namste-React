# higher order component
higher order component is a function that takes a component and returns a component:it takes a component as an input and enhance it or tweaks the component or add extra features to the component and returns it back.

# important topics to revise 
  - lifting the state up  
  - props drilling, to avoid props drilling react gives us a super power known as context
     - to use createContext 
     ```
     import {createContext} from "react"

     const UserContext = createContext(
      loggedInUser: "default user"
     )

     export default UserContext;
     ```

     - to use context we can use useContext hook 
     ```
     useContext()
     ```
     
     - we cannot use the useContext hook in class component so we use <UserContext.Consumer>
