# EP-03 Laying the foundation

## instead of running ``npx parcel index.html`` for development and ``npx parcel build index.html``  for production build you can add or configure this in the ``package.json`` file.

```
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest",
        "start": "parcel index.html",
        "build": "parcel build index.html"
      },
```
## command line

  - to start the project as development mode
```
   npm run start or npm start
```

   - to run as a production build
```
   npm run build
```

# Q.what is ``JSX (Javascript syntax)``

>[!IMPORTANT]
> - ``JSX`` and ``react`` are different ``JSX`` is ``not a part of react`` 
> - JSX is not a ``HTML``  it is ``HTML like or XML like Syntax`` -``but not HTML``
> - JSX will sanitize the ``malicious`` code or defend the code from ``attacker`` or ``illigal`` activity when using a ``API``
>
> ## react core code 
>```
>    // react.createElement => React Element - JS object => HTMLelement(render)
>
>    const parent = React.createElement("div", { id: "parent" }, "Hi from React")
>```


>[!IMPORTANT]
> ## JSX code
>    - JSX (transpiled before going to js-engine)
>    - Transpilation is done by ``PARCEL`` using ``Babel``
>    - BABEL is a package installed by parcel when we install parcel

>[!NOTE]
> ## Q. How JSX diff from HTML
>    - Another example that JSx is not Babel, is in html you give class name as ``class= "classname"`` but in ``JSX you give className= "classname" ``
>    - Attributes in JSX use ``camel-casing``

>[!IMPORTANT]
># Diff b/w JSX and HTML code
> - ### valid code
> ```
>          const JSXelement = <h1 id="heading"> Hi from JSX</h1>
>```
> - ### not valid code
>```
>         const JSXelement = <h1 id="heading"> 
>                                 Hi from JSX
>                             </h1>
>```
> - ### instead wrap it in round brackets
>```
>         const JSXelement = (<h1 id="heading"> 
>                                 Hi from JSX
>                             </h1>)
>```


## Q. what does Babel do 
   - Babel takes your ``JSX`` code and converts into the code that ``js engine`` understands
```
   //JSX - HTML like or XML like syntax
   // JSX => React.createElement => React Element - JS object => HTMLelement(render)

   const JSXelement = <h1 id="heading"> Hi from JSX</h1>
   
   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
   
   root.render(JSXelement);
```

# Q. Components
## There are 2 types of Components 

## 1. Class component - Old
## 2. Functional Component - New

   - functinoal component is nothing but ``Javascript function that returns some piece of JSX code or react element``
   - Functinal components name always start with ``capital letter``

```
     const Jsxelement = () => <h1 id="header">Hi from JSX</h1>;
```
  - sames as 
```
   const Jsxelement = () => (
    <h1 id="header">Hi from JSX</h1>;
   )   
```
  - ## Diff between element and component
     - ### Component
       ```
         const Jsxelement = () => (
         <h1 id="header">Hi from JSX</h1>;
         ) 
       ```
    - ### element does not have function
       ```
        const Jsxelement = (
        <h1 id="header">Hi from JSX</h1>;
        ) 
       ```


 - ## ``Component composition``
    - Functional Component inside another component is called component composition
      ```
      const Jsxelement = () => {
        return <h1 id="header">Hi from JSX</h1>;
      }
      const FunctionalComponent = () =>(
       <div id="container">
          <Jsxelement/>
          <h1 id="functional">Hi from Functional Component</h1>
       </div>
       );
      ```
 - ## And you can only render the functinal component as
      ```
      root.render(<FunctionalComponent/>)
      ```

# Javascript in JSX

  - You can use javascript inside a component by using {} curly braces
  - You can perform Javascript expression inside a component
  - You can call another React element inside React element
    ```
      const ele = (
        <h1>element</h1>
      )
      
      const element2 = (
        <div>
          {ele}
          <h1>element2</h1>
        </div>
      ) 
      
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      
      root.render(element2);
    ```

  - You can call functional component as a function also like jsx
  - You can call components inside element and element inside component 

    ```
      const Jsxelement = () => {
      return <h1 id="header">Hi from JSX</h1>;
      }
      
      const num = 5;
      
      const FunctionalComponent = () => {
        return (
          <div id="container">
            {/* this is comment inside JSX */}
             {/* calling another functional component  */}
            <Jsxelement/>
            {/* calling as a Javascript function - must have () as a function */}
            {Jsxelement()}
            {/* using expressions */}
            {num}
            {7 + 6}
            <h1 id="functional">Hi from Functional Component</h1>
          </div>
        );
      };

       const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      
      root.render(<FunctionalComponent/>);
    ```
## At the end of the dayðŸ§¨ðŸ¤¯ (Everything is JS)
   
   - React is Javascript at the end of the day
   - Functional components are functions at the end of the day
   - JSX are React.createElement at the end of the day
   - React.createElement is object at the end of the day
