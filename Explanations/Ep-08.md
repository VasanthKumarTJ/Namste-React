# class component ðŸš€

```
class User extends React.Component{

  render(){
 
    const {name} = this.props

    return(
      <div>
        <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
        <h2>Contact: vasanthtj8@gmail.com</h2>

## pass a props in class component

```
   class User extends React.Component{
     constructor(props){
       super(props)
     }
   
     render(){
    
       const {name} = this.props
   
       return(
         <div>
           <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
           <h2>Contact: vasanthtj8@gmail.com</h2>
         </div>
       )
     }
   }
  export default User;
```
## passing a prop in about.js with prop name as **name**
```
  import User from "./User";
  
  const About = () => {
    return(
      <div>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <User name={"Vasanth Kumar.T.J"}/>
      </div>
    )
  }

  export default About;
```

## Q: (Research) Why do we use `super(props)` in constructor?
A: `super(props)` is used to inherit the properties and access of variables of the React parent class when we initialize our component.
super() is used inside constructor of a class to derive the parent's all properties inside the class that extended it. If super() is not used, then Reference Error : Must call super constructor in derived classes before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor is thrown in the console.
The main difference between super() and super(props) is the this.props is undefined in child's constructor in super() but this.props contains the passed props if super(props) is used.

# Creating state varibales in Class Component

  ## State varibles in Functional Component
  whenever mounting or invoking means you are returning some jsx from the fuctional component.

```
     const[count] = useState(0);
     
     //using varible
     <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
```
  ## State varibles in class Component
  Whenever Loading a class based component means you are creating a instance of a class so constructor is the best way to create the state varibales and receiving props.

```
      class UserClass extends React.Component{
        constructor(props){
          super(props)
          this.state = {
            count: 0,
          }
        }
      
        render(){
          //destructering on the fly
          const {count} = this.state
      
          return(
            <div className="user-container">
      
              //using varible
              <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      
            </div>
          )
        }
      }
```
  ## Creating multiple state varibles
```
      //in functional component
      const[count] = useState(0);
      const[count1] = useState(1);
   
      // in class component
      constructor(props){
             super(props)
             this.state = {
               count: 0,
               count1: 2,
             }
           }
```
# updating a state Variable
updating a state varible in class component is diff than functional component, in functional component we update using setName() but in class component we update using this.setate() method and this method take an object **{}** this object contains the update state 
```
    <button onClick={ () => {
      this.setState({
        count: count + 1
      });
    }}>increase count</button>
```
and if you have multiple state variable you can update it like this.
```
  <button onClick={ () => {
      this.setState({
        count: count + 1,
        count1: count1 + 1,
      });
    }}>increase count</button>
```

>## Q. life cycle of class based component on how mounting/loading/rendering the class component works ðŸš€
>if you render the class based component first it will create a instance of the class and it will load the constructor then it will load the render() method, if there is a parent class component inside parent there is child component then the parent constructor loads > parent render loads > child constructor > child render
>
>## Q. ComponentDidMount() {} lifecycle 
>- if the class component have **componentDidMount()** method then first **constructor** is called first, then **render()>** is called, then **componentDidMount()** renders only after the **constructor** and **render()**
>
>- if the parent as well as child has **componentDidMount()** method then **parents constructor > parents render > child constructor > child render > child componentDidMount > parent componentDidMount**. oncle all the child component renders or life cycle of child triggers then only the parent component render.
>
>## Why we use componentDidMount()
>as componentDidMount is as same as useEffect it will invoked only after the render phase finishes, so `it will be used to call api as we use useEffect in functional component`

> first react will renders the `render phase ` as updating UI is expensive it will optimize or batch the process of `commit phase` Ex. if you have parent inside 2 child component it will render the **render phase** of **parent** then **render phase of child1** then **child2** then after finishing up it will come to **commit phase**, in commit phase at **first updates DOM as it is expensive: like vitual dom check the diff between old and new then updates UI**. so it will **optimize** as we can say batch **the two child's render phase**, render the render phase that is componentDidMount() is called. then parents **render phase** is called.

---------------------------------------------
## Life cycle explained ðŸš€

------------ MOUNTING--------------
- Constructor (dummy)
- Render (dummy)
    <HTML Dummy>
- Component Did Mount
    <API Call>
    <this.setState> -> State variable is updated

-------------UPDATE-----------------

- render (API date)
    <HTML (new API date)>
- component Did Update

-----when you exit webpage----------

- coponent will unmount
