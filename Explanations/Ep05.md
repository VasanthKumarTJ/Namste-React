# Good Convention used in industry and good practices 🚀 

## utils folder 📁
  ### constants.js, mockData.js
   - used to store hard coded datas
   - use this folder to store all the utility files and constant files like cdn links etc..
   - use full caps to CDN links


## Components folder 📁
   use this folder to store all the components like Header, Footer, Body etc.. and give these file name as same as according to its component name and use caps first letter so that people know that it is component file

# Imports and Exports 🚀
   
   - always remember to export  before import

   ## ways to export  🏁
    
      1. ### Default way
          you can only export one default 
        ```
        export default ComponentName
        ```
      2. ### Named export
            it is Generally used when in a single file you have to export multiple things
            ### How - you can name export in front of your variable or what you want to export
            ```
            export const CDN_URL = "https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/" 
            ```

   ## ways to import  🏁
    
      1. ### Default way
        
        ```
        import ComponentName from "FilePath"
        ```

      2. ### Named import 
        ```
        import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants";
        ``` 

## Q.Is using named and default exports together?
It's important to note that a file can have both named and default exports together. This means you can export one main thing using export default , while also exporting multiple additional values using export

># react Hooks 🚀
>## Q. What is react Hook
>it is a noraml JS utility  function, It keeps the **UI layer and data Layer in sync**
>
>  ## 1.State variable 🏁
>  - useState()
>  - useEFfect()
>
>  ## state varibale ( Super powerful variable ) 🏁
>  to create the super powerful variable we use ``Hooks``. ``Whenever a state varibale updates react re-renders the componenet``
>
>  ### Creation 🏁
>  ```
>  import {useState} from "react";
>  ```
>    - when you  use ``useState()`` varible you receive a powerful vaible to catch that varible you use const [varName]
>
>
>  ```
>  //state varibale - Super powerful variable 
>  const [restaurantList] = useState([]);   
>
>  //normal varibale
>  let restaurantList = [];
>
>  //update normVar
>  restaurantList = ["fasdf];
>
>  //update stateVar
>  const [restaurantList, setrestaurantList] = useState([]);
>
>  setrestaruantList(["sdfd]);
>  ```
>    - you give the values of an array as same as in the normal varibale 
>    - you can update the useState varibale by using the function ``setrestaurantList()`` 
>    - in industry it is a convention to give the ``function name`` of the state variable as same as ``variable name`` with ``set`` in prefix  

>[!NOTE]
> ## Destructuring the useState (Local state variable) 🏁
>```
>const arr = useState[restaurantList]; is basically
>
> array desturcturing: const [resList, setRestList]; you can basicallt write it as
>
> const resList = arr[0];
>
> const resList = arr[1];
>```

># Q.Why react is faster
>**Ans:** Because it uses **efficient DOM manipulation**: Means it uses Virtual DOM. and it has a **Diff Algorithm**: for ex. if there are 7 restaurants in swiggy after clicking of top rated restaurants button it will render lets say 3 so, basically it finds the diff of 4 restaurants and re-renders or refreshes it That`s why react is faster

# Q.Reconsiliation Algorithm (React Fiber)
- when ever something changes on the UI it is known as reconsiliation 
- new algorithm ``React Fiber `` which came in `react16` `After it is known as react Fiber algorithm` now we are learning `18`. It uses `Diff algorithm` which basically find the differnece between two object and re-renders the dom **for ex. if there are 7 restaurants in swiggy after clicking of top rated restaurants button it will render lets say 3 so, basically it finds the diff of 4 restaurants and re-renders or refreshes it That`s why react is faster**
- finding the diff b/w two html in difficult but finding diff b/w two object is easy as reactComponents are basically objects

  - ## Q.What is Virtual Dom 🏁
       - Virtual DOM is a ``representation`` of the ``Actual Dom``
  - ## Q.What is Actual DOM 🏁
       - Actual DOM contains tags Ex.<div>, <input>, <button> etc..,
  - ## Virtual DOM 🏁
       - Vitual DOM is nothing but a noraml JS object if you console.log(<Body/>) component you will get object. basically ``React.createElement >>is ReactElement >>> is object ``
       ``EX. 👇``
     ```
           {
             let [restaurantList, setRestaurantList] = useState(RestaurantList);
             return (
               <div className="body">
                 <div className="Top-rated">
                   <button
                     onClick={() => {
                       const topRatedRestaurants = restaurantList.filter((restaurant) => {
                         return restaurant.info.avgRating > 4;
                       });
                       setRestaurantList(topRatedRestaurants);
                     }}
                   >
                     Top rated
                   </button>
                 </div>
                 <div className="restaurant-container">
                   {restaurantList.map((restaurant) => (
                     <RestaurantCard
                       key={restaurant.info.id}
                       restaurantData={restaurant}
                     />
                   ))}
                 </div>
               </div>
             );
           };
     ```


## At the end of the day🧨🤯 (Everything is JS)
   
   - React is Javascript at the end of the day
   - Functional components are functions at the end of the day
   - JSX are React.createElement at the end of the day
   - React.createElement is object at the end of the day
   - react HOok is a normal Js functions
